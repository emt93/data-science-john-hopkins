##Getting and Cleaning Data - Project 1 

At the moment this repo contains code called run_analysis.R which analyses a dataset based off of Samsung smartphone accelerometer data which can be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

For this script to run, one needs to download the data into a working directory. 

To get a better understanding of the data and it's authors, I recommend you to checkout http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
